# senpai-aur
This is an _unofficial_ AUR package for the [senpai IRC client](https://sr.ht/~taiite/senpai/).

It is in no way endorsed by upstream, so make sure you can distinguish between their bugs and ours ;)

The AUR package used to be named `senpai-irc` due to conflict with an existing `senpai` package. As of Jun 27, 2023, the other package has been deleted. So this package has been renamed to `senpai` for clarity.

The package has been mirrored to Github.

PRs and issues are welcome.
